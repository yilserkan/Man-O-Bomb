# Man-O-Bomb

# About the game
This is my version of bomberman. This game can only be played coop. The players can place bombs which can destroy the wooden boxes and kill the other player. The wooden boxes have the chance to drop power ups when destroyed. 

There are 2 different power ups currently in the game. One of them increases the range of the explosion and the other one increases the amount of bombs a player can place at the same time.

The goal of this game is to kill the other player.

## Used Design Pattern
- Object Pooling
